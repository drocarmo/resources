Resources
===================

Go through the list [here](http://drocarmo.com/resources).

This is where I store some of my favorite resources around the topic of product design and development, for the practice of always learning and inspiring from other people on the web.

It includes talks, essays and articles on the best practices, theories and principles of designing for the web. Help me by add to the list. Just [fork it](https://github.com/drocarmo/resources/fork), edit it and submit a pull-request.

â˜… Largely inspired by [Jason James](https://twitter.com/jas0njames/)' collection of resources on [ChiPD](http://chi-p-d.com/resources/) and [Robert Lenne](https://twitter.com/robertlenne)'s [Required Reading for Product Designers](http://www.robertlenne.com/requiredreading/).
