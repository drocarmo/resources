Resources
===================

[Go through the list here.](http://drocarmo.com/resources)

This is where I store some of my favorite resources around the topic of product design and development, for the practice of always learning and inspiring from other people on the web.

*I was largely inspired by [Jason James](https://twitter.com/jas0njames/)' collection of resources on [ChiPD](http://chi-p-d.com/resources/) and [Robert Lenne](https://twitter.com/robertlenne)'s [“Required Reading for Product Designers”](http://www.robertlenne.com/requiredreading/) and [Jason Santa Maria](https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria)'s recommended [Reading](http://jasonsantamaria.com/reading/).
